<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">The 23-year-old previously played for Benfica in his homeland before switching to the Spanish capital in the summer of 2019, for a record fee for both clubs.
<br><br>
A skilful and stylish attacker, Joao Felix is most effective when roaming fluidly across the forward line and involving himself in the build-up play.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Joao Felix started his football journey with Porto at the age of eight, making the 150-mile trip from his hometown Viseu several times a week. He was a diminutive yet gifted youngster who soon caught the eye of talent spotters around the country and switched clubs to Benfica as a 15-year-old in 2015.
<br><br>
Taking advantage of the ‘B’ team model in Portugal, where top-flight clubs have reserve teams in the second tier, Joao made his professional debut for Benfica’s second string at the age of 16 - the youngest player to represent the side at the time.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/1-Felix-Nov-2016-UYL-GettyImages-620090856.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/> <br><br>
He played 30 league matches in two seasons between 2016 and 2018, also featuring for the club’s Under-19 side in the UEFA Youth League, scoring six goals as they finished runners-up to Red Bull Salzburg in the year that Chelsea were holders.
<br><br>
It was no surprise when Joao was promoted into the Benfica first team at the start of the 2018/19 campaign, a season that would prove to be a breakthrough one for him personally and a successful one for the club as they secured the Primeira Liga title.
<br><br>
Having scored crucial goals against title rivals Sporting Lisbon and Porto, as well as a Europa League hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals, he finished with 20 in all competitions. The last of those came on the final day as Benfica beat Santa Clara 4-1 to seal the title in what proved to be Joao’s final game for the Eagles.
<br><br>
Still only 19 upon arrival in Spain at Atletico Madrid, the teenage Joao Felix returned nine goals in 36 appearances, including three in six in his maiden Champions League campaign, as Los Rojiblancos finished third in La Liga and reached the quarter-finals in Europe’s premier club competition. They were beaten by Leipzig in the delayed, truncated knockout stage, with the penalty won and converted by Joao not enough in a 2-1 defeat to the Germans.
<br><br>
Earlier in the campaign, he was recognised individually with the prestigious Golden Boy award, honouring him as the best young player in Europe and marking both that breakthrough campaign with Benfica and the start of his Atletico career.
<br><br>
2020/21 saw Atleti crowned Spanish champions for the first time in seven years and Joao Felix started the season in fine form, netting eight of his 10 goals before Christmas, although injury and illness then resulted in a stop-start run in the team through late winter and spring. His most significant contribution came in the penultimate La Liga clash against Osasuna, as he teed up Renan Lodi for a crucial goal in a comeback win that kept Simeone’s side top a week before their coronation.
<br><br>
The last 18 months before his loan move to Chelsea saw the forward recover from an ankle injury that hindered his minutes, although he still managed 15 goals in 55 appearances during that time and was named 2021/22 Atletico Madrid Player of the Season by the club’s supporters. A run of seven goals in eight matches from February to April 2022 earned him the fan accolade, with his season ended early by injury following Atleti’s narrow European exit at the hands of Manchester City.
<br><br>
Joao made 20 club appearances for the Colchoneros in 2022/23, including twice between the World Cup break and joining Chelsea, scoring in a 2-0 win over Elche at the end of 2022.	  
</p>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Joao Felix's senior international debut arrived in memorable style in the summer of 2019, as he started Portugal's UEFA Nations League semi-final win over Switzerland en route to lifting the trophy on home soil.
<br><br>
He has been a regular member of their squad ever since, also competing at Euro 2020, although an injury meant his only appearance in the tournament was as a substitute in their last-16 defeat to Belgium.
<br><br>
At the Qatar World Cup in late 2022, he scored Portugal's second goal - and his fourth for his country overall - in their 3-2 win over Ghana in their opening match. Joao Felix also provided two World Cup assists, both in a 6-1 thrashing of Switzerland in the last 16.</p>
