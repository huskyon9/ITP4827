<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">A direct dribbler who thrives in any position across the front three or just behind a central striker, Sterling utilises a perfect combination of skill, speed and timing to torment defenders, whether with the ball at his feet or with his consistently productive runs in behind.
<br><br>
The England international’s offensive attributes have posted impressive numbers in recent seasons, including 25 goal contributions in 2021/22 as Man City retained the domestic title and reached the Champions League semi-finals. The majority of his goals are converted from close range, a testament to the forward’s clever movement and impeccable timing in the 18-yard box.
<br><br>
Since 2016/17 and prior to 2022/23, he was one of only eight players to have scored 80 or more Premier League goals, averaging 22 in all competitions across the past five seasons, as well as an average of 10 assists per term over the same period.</p>

	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Sterling started his first season with Chelsea in an unfamiliar role as well as surroundings, with Thomas Tuchel using the England international in the centre of his attack rather than his usual wide position.
<br><br>
It didn't seem to faze the new arrival though, as he marked his first home game for the club by setting up Reece James' goal in a 2-2 draw with London rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/Sterling_Leicester_H_celeb_GettyImages-1418490626.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  <br><br>
		  
A promising start to life with the Blues continued as he netted both goals in a 2-1 win over Leicester City in our next game at Stamford Bridge, before opening the scoring away at Southampton, giving him a healthy tally of three goals and an assist in five games during his first month with Chelsea.
<br><br>
Sterling mostly returned to a wider role in Graham Potter's fluid system, following the Englishman's arrival as head coach in September, although that didn't stop him from netting the first goal of Potter's Chelsea reign, when he opened the scoring against Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League.
<br><br>
The goals didn't come quite so freely after that, but another in Europe against Dinamo Zagreb at the Bridge meant Sterling still went into the winter World Cup break as Chelsea's top scorer in all competitions.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born in the Jamaican capital Kingston, Sterling was raised in London from the age of five and grew up in north-west London. He spent six years in the academy at Queen’s Park Rangers before making a switch to Liverpool in February 2010 as a precocious 15-year-old.
<br><br>
In his five years at Liverpool Sterling developed into one of the brightest young talents in the country. He made his senior debut as a substitute in March 2012, not long after his 17th birthday, and then enjoyed a breakthrough campaign at Anfield the following season with 36 appearances for the Reds under Brendan Rodgers, as well as making his England debut.
<br><br>
It was as part of Liverpool’s much-vaunted attack in 2013/14, alongside Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, that Sterling’s Premier League career caught light with some big goals in an unlikely title charge. As well as netting in a comprehensive away win at Tottenham, he also bagged a brace against Arsenal and opened the scoring in a crucial victory over Manchester City, hitting double figures for goals in a season for the first time. His sparkling form saw him win the Golden Boy award in December 2014.
<br><br>
Sterling, operating predominantly from the flanks at this time, went on to hit 20 goal involvements the following season and scored against Chelsea in the League Cup semi-finals in January with a typically smart run and finish, though it wasn’t enough to get past Jose Mourinho’s side.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2015, a deal was agreed to take him from Merseyside to Manchester, making him the most expensive English player at the time. The winger’s first season at the Etihad was solid if unspectacular and saw him claim a first piece of silverware in the shape of the League Cup, however the arrival of Pep Guardiola as manager the following year elevated Sterling’s game to new heights.
<br><br>
Initially on the left of a 4-3-3, Sterling developed an uncanny knack of driving infield with explosive acceleration and smart close ball control. While Guardiola’s maiden campaign in England was a trophyless one, it undoubtedly laid the foundations for what was to come and a pair of late goals at the start of 2017/18’s title-winning season helped City gain crucial momentum. As well as hitting a record 100 points, they also secured the first of four consecutive League Cup triumphs that term, and Sterling finished with a then-career-high 23 goals to his name.
<br><br>
Those numbers continued to rise year on year as he honed an uncanny knack of arriving in the box to finish off incisive attacking moves. His 50th Premier League goal was scored on the opening weekend of 2018/19, a campaign in which he netted twice in the FA Cup final and converted the winning penalty in the League Cup final shoot-out as City claimed a domestic treble. His individual efforts in collective glory led to Sterling being named PFA Young Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.
<br><br>
As forward reinforcements arrived and Guardiola’s City evolved, so too did Sterling’s role in the team, from pacey wideman to intricate build-up playmaker and even false nine. In 2019/20 he reached 30 goals in a season for the first time, aided by a penchant for hat-tricks that saw him hit four in the calendar year of 2019 and finish as the club’s top goalscorer that term.
<br><br>
His final two campaigns in Manchester were similarly productive as the team secured back-to-back league titles aided by big goals from the forward home and away against Arsenal in 2020/21, as well as his former club Liverpool and Wolves. He joined the Premier League’s 100 club in December 2021 and notched one of his most eye-catching City strikes with a curling effort from distance against Sporting Lisbon two months later.
<br><br>
Trophy success in Europe remains a target for Sterling. He hit 24 goals on the continental stage prior to joining the Blues, with 2021’s final defeat to Chelsea the closest he has come so far to lifting the Champions League. He left Man City having made 339 appearances and scored 131 goals.

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>On the international stage, Sterling has become a regular for Gareth Southgate. As of July 2022 he had 77 England caps and 19 goals, including three at Euro 2020 where he helped the Three Lions reach the final at Wembley, a short mazy dribble away where he spent his youth and developed his love for the game.
<br><br>
Sterling made his debut for England in November 2012 and has been named in the squad for the five major international tournaments since. He has captained the Three Lions on four occasions.
<br><br>
After helping the Three Lions reach the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and final of Euro 2020, his first tournament as a Chelsea player arrived in Qatar at the 2022 World Cup. A great start saw him score England's third goal and set up the fourth in a 6-2 thrashing of Iran, but he returned home for personal reasons after another start against the USA in their second match.
<br><br>
Sterling rejoined the England squad the day before coming off the bench for the last 10 minutes of their narrow defeat to France in the quarter-finals.</p>
