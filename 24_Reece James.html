<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">Also capable of playing in a back-three or midfield, James is a graduate of our development centre programme and has been training with us since the age of six.</p>
<button class="team-menu"> 2019/2020 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>James suffered an ankle injury on international duty over the summer of 2018, so had to wait until late September before making his Blues bow. He marked the occasion with a goal, too, superbly curling a 20-yarder in against Grimsby in a big Carabao Cup win.
<br><br> 
A week later he started in the Champions League as we defeated Lille in France, showing no signs of nerves on such a big stage, and demonstrating his attacking talents on the right as a wing-back.
<br><br>
		   <img src="media file/player/ajax_home_celebration.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
The landmarks kept coming. He made his Premier League debut off the bench against Newcastle United, and his first start in the competition as we beat Crystal Palace 2-0, with James earning plaudits for the manner in which he kept Wilfried Zaha quiet, this time as a right-back.
<br><br> 
Between those two games he scored a dramatic equaliser against Ajax (above), capping an incredible comeback from 4-1 down in 35 minutes after coming on at half-time, becoming Chelsea’s youngest-ever scorer in the Champions League and sparking delirium inside the Bridge.
<br><br> 
James’ versatility on the right was an important asset for Lampard throughout the season, being utilised at full-back or wing-back, although he was also used in a back-three on occasion and came on for Mason Mount in midfield during the 4-0 victory over Everton in March.
<br><br> 
His maturity and the trust he had earned by the end of the campaign was demonstrated when played the full 90 minutes in both the FA Cup semi-final and final, as well as the second leg of the Champions League tie away at Bayern Munich.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>The right-back couldn’t have wished for a better start to the 2020/21 season, hammering home a stunning strike as we defeated Brighton 3-1 at the Amex Stadium on opening day.
<br><br>
His goal came after Leandro Trossard had cancelled out Jorginho’s opener, before Kurt Zouma added a third for the Blues to ensure we left the south coast with all three points. The defender was the deliverer of the corner that led to Zouma’s goal.
<br><br>
That would be Reece’s only Premier League goal of the campaign, but what a strike it was!
<br><br>
Reece quickly established himself as Chelsea’s first-choice right-back under Frank Lampard at the start of the season, keeping the more experienced Cesar Azpilicueta out of the side to begin with. The arrival of Thomas Tuchel saw the skipper return to the side with more regularity but that wasn’t necessarily at the expense of James. Our German head coach’s preference for a three at the back with wing-backs allowed for Azpi and James to co-exist at right central defender and right wing-back respectively on many occasions.
<br><br>
James even featured as the right centre-back on occasions too. Tuchel picked him in that role when we played against Leicester in both the Premier League and the FA Cup final, with the German pinpointing the defender’s pace and power as a way to combat Jamie Vardy in the Foxes frontline. While you’re most likely to see Reece line-up at right-back, the England international also showed his versatility by moving into central midfield on occasions to help see games out.
<br><br>
Without question, the highlight of James – and Chelsea’s – season came in the sunshine of Porto at the end of May. The defender was a key component of the Blues side that defeated Manchester City 1-0 to win the Champions League for the second time in our history. James played the entire 90 minutes at right wing-back and was praised for the way he limited the threat of City’s Raheem Sterling, with the England winger unable to get the better of James and cutting a frustrated figure throughout.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>For Reece James, the 2021/22 season can be viewed as one of high achievement interrupted midway through by a muscle injury serious enough to keep him from the pitch for a combined 12 whole weeks.
<br><br>
Even with the injury, James was only one short of 40 appearances for the season, and his six goals placed him as our eighth top scorer. In fact it goes further than that. During their pomp in the autumn part of the season, James and his fellow wing-back on the opposite flank, Ben Chilwell, were one of the team’s principle attacking threats, given licence by Thomas Tuchel to not only run forward but also to enter the penalty area regularly – adding to the attacking numbers there as an often unpicked-up threat.
<br><br>
Also like Chilwell, James did not begin the season as a starter having returned from his summer break later than most due to his presence in the England squad for the Euros, but after the Super Cup and the Premier League opener, by the third game he was back in the starting 11 and made an immediate and outstanding impact, squaring for Romelu Lukaku to score early on and then firing in the second goal of a victory at Arsenal.
<br><br>
A harsh red card for a goal-line handball at Anfield in the following game was a rare setback but despite the penalty conceded, the team left Liverpool with a draw and James was soon back winning for club and country.
<br><br>
He contributed a top-quality goal to the 7-0 thrashing of Norwich and with Chilwell by now back in the side and scoring freely, the attacking weapon that was our wing-backs was now being widely noticed. Tuchel would later confirm he classed that position in this system more as a midfielder than a defender.
<br><br>
James built himself a reputation in 2021/22 as not only a reliable penalty taker but one who could do so in the most pressured situations. In two rounds running of the Carabao Cup he converted the fifth and decisive spot-kick in shoot-outs against Premier League opposition, before later slotting one in the marathon at the end of the final of that competition against Liverpool. He also scored a penalty when the FA Cup final against the same team finished goalless too. Sadly at the end of each of those Wembley occasions, James received a runner-up medal.
<br><br>
The threat in the attacking third of the pitch from James was no better showcased than during our trip to Newcastle in October. Having been frustrated by defensive opponents for over an hour, the England international cracked in a left-foot shot to break the deadlock and followed it soon after with one from his right foot to set us on the way to a 3-0 win. For a period he was our Premier League top scorer.
<br><br>
An assist in each of the next two games followed, including a cross for Romelu Lukaku to head home against Burnley, before one of the season highlights – a 4-0 win against Juventus at Stamford Bridge.
<br><br>
With a chest down and clean strike, James was on target as for the first time in a Chelsea Champions League match, there were three different English goalscorers, and all products of our Academy (Trevoh Chalobah and Callum Hudson-Odoi were the other two). It was his one European goal in 2021/22.
<br><br>
In December at West Ham, four days before his 22nd birthday, he played his 100th Chelsea game, that milestone reached just over three years after his debut.
<br><br>
Chelsea had been top of the table for two months until defeat that day in the Olympic Park but now points began to slip away fairly regularly. James played the pass for Mason Mount to open the scoring at home to Everton but that ended in a draw and with Covid and other injuries (including to Chilwell) biting in midwinter, we could ill afford to lose James for any length of time.
<br><br>
A serious muscle tear suffered in the last game of 2021 kept James out for two months. He then returned briefly (and scored a very skilful opener at Burnley) but needed further time out for full recovery so it was not until April that his season restarted properly started.
<br><br>
By that time the team were in the Champions League quarter-finals, the FA Cup semi-finals and attempting to consolidate third position in the Premier League. On occasions James was asked to play on the right of a back-three including in the Bernabeu where Chelsea so nearly overcame a big first-leg deficit. His pace, power, and calmness in playing out from tight situations caught the eye that night in Spain and those qualities were on display for the rest of the campaign.
<br><br>
James provided a quality assist in each of our last three league games of the season and his final total for supplying assists was just one fewer than Mount’s 10.

<div class="team-content">
      <p>Reece James's outstanding performance levels continued when the 2022/23 campaign got underway. Whether deployed at right-back or right wing-back, he remained a major threat in the final third and got off the mark for the season in the first home game, finishing emphatically past Hugo Lloris in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham.
<br><br>
He provided an assist for Raheem Sterling in our next home fixture, against Leicester, and marked his 100th start for the Blues in style. He produced a virtuoso performance against the Italian champions AC Milan, scoring one and setting up another as Europe again took notice of his talent.
<br><br>
Sadly, in the reverse fixture the following week, James sustained a knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup.

	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Academy ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>James started out mostly as a striker before moving further back into midfield and defence. He made his youth-team debut while still a schoolboy in 2015/16 before becoming a key figure in our Treble-winning Under-18 season the following year.
<br><br>
His versatility was a key attribute as he featured at right-back, wing-back and in a central defensive back three throughout the campaign, playing in every game as the Youth Cup was successfully retained and scoring a brilliant header in the semi-final at White Hart Lane.
<br><br>
In March 2017, James signed a first professional contract at the club which ran until the end of the 2018/19 campaign. He continued his good form in 2017/18, captaining the Under-18s to another FA Youth Cup triumph and being named Academy Player of the Season.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> On loan ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>In June 2018, he signed a four-year Chelsea contract and went on loan to Wigan Athletic in the Championship for the forthcoming season.
<br><br>
There he was a huge success. He was instrumental in helping Wigan stay in the Championship and received an astonishing 96 per cent of the votes from Latics supporters in their Player of the Year poll.
<br><br>
He played at right-back and central midfield and was also voted Wigan’s Players’ Player of the Year. To top it off he won the club’s Goal of the Season award for a brilliant hit away to Bristol City.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>He was a key part of the England Under-17 side that triumphed at the Toulon Tournament in the summer of 2017. There he impressed to such an extent he was named in the team of the competition. He travelled to the European Under-19 Championship the same year, before stepping up to Under-21 level in October 2019.
<br><br>
Almost exactly a year later received his first call-up to the England senior squad. His debut for the Three Lions soon followed, on 8 October 2020, when he came on as a substitute in the second half of a 3-0 win over Wales at Wembley Stadium, and he made his first start as a wing-back against Denmark in the Nations League, although he was shown a red card after the final whistle of that 1-0 defeat.
<br><br>
James was named as part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2020, making one appearance for the Three Lions as he played every minute of the 0-0 draw against Scotland in the group stage. He was an unused substitute for four of their remaining five games, including the semis and the final as they lost out to Italy on penalties at Wembley.
<br><br>
He continued to feature as England qualified for the 2022 Qatar World Cup.
