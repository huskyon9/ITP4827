<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">That was shortly after he had become a World Cup winner with Argentina in Qatar, having also caught the eye with a string of impressive performances for Benfica during his debut campaign in Europe.
<br><br>
Fernandez was initially a defensive-minded player, but possesses the technical ability to operate as a playmaker and the athleticism to support attacks and go box-to-box, becoming regarded as a complete midfielder.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born in San Martin on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in January 2001, Enzo Fernandez joined River Plate aged just five, having stood out playing for his local team Club La Recova.
<br><br>
Fernandez progressed through River’s fabled academy system and was called up to the reserve squad early in 2019. He soon played his first game at that level, and within days took another significant step in his fledgling senior career, making River’s first-team bench for their defeat to Patronato barely a week after his 18th birthday. River manager Marcelo Gallardo carefully managed his development and waited until March 2020 before handing him his River debut in a Copa Libertadores defeat to LDU Quito. 
	<br><br>	  
		  Soon after, Gallardo advised Fernandez to go out on loan to gain experience. He duly joined Hernan Crespo’s Defensa y Justicia. Fernandez quickly earned his place in the starting XI at one of Buenos Aires' smaller top-flight clubs, showcasing his technical ability under the management of former Chelsea striker Hernan Crespo.
<br><br>
Fernandez and the Hawks’ star burned brightest in the Copa Sudamericana, South America’s equivalent of the Europa League. He started both legs of a 4-2 aggregate semi-final success over Chile’s Coquimbo Unido in January 2021, and then shone in the final against Argentinean rivals Lanus. Defensa y Justicia won 3-0, securing their first honour in a generation, and first ever in continental competition.<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/fernandez-palmeiras-defensa.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/> <br><br>
A second international triumph swiftly followed. Fernandez played throughout both legs of the Recopa Sudamericana, CONMEBOL’s answer to the UEFA Super Cup. Against Copa Libertadores champions Palmeiras, Fernandez more than held his own as Defensa y Justicia overturned a 3-1 aggregate deficit to take the showpiece to penalties. Fernandez made no mistake with his.
<br><br>
Fernandez’s performances had caught the eye and Gallardo ended his loan, which was due to run until December 2021, early. He returned to River, who were flying high in the table, in July, and went straight into their starting XI.
<br><br>
Fernandez scored his first goal for his boyhood club against Velez Sarsfield in August 2021, providing an assist in the same game. River won the league title with three games to spare, with Fernandez featuring 15 times in all. He had his third winners’ medal in the same calendar year.
		<br><br>  
		  In the first half of 2022 his game reached a new level. Fernandez scored 10 goals and registered six assists in 26 appearances for River Plate in league and cup. Unsurprisingly, his performances did not go unnoticed in Europe, and in the summer he joined Benfica, a club renowned for importing South American starlets.
<br><br>
Fernandez took no time adapting to his new surroundings in Portugal. So impressive were his performances he was named the Liga Nos' best midfielder in August, October and November.
	<br><br>	  
		  Prior to his move to Chelsea in January, Fernandez played 29 times for Benfica in 2022/23, scoring four goals and laying on seven more as the Eagles went undefeated in the league and Europe, leaving them first in the Liga Nos table and into the knockout stages of the Champions League after topping a group containing Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus.

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Having previously made two appearances at Under-20 level in 2019, Enzo Fernandez was called up by Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni for a pair of friendlies in September 2022. He came off the bench in wins against Honduras and Jamaica to earn his first two caps for his country, propelling him into their squad for the World Cup two months later.
<br><br>	 
It was Fernandez’s introduction off the bench in Argentina’s second game in Qatar, against Mexico, that helped spring them into life following a shock reverse to Saudi Arabia. He whipped in a superb goal on the angle after dummying past his defender to put the seal on a 2-0 win from which Scaloni’s side never looked back.

		  
	Fernandez started the next game, setting up a goal for Julian Alvarez as Argentina beat Poland, and he didn’t miss a minute of their stunning knockout campaign. Positioned at the base of Argentina’s midfield trio, Fernandez’s tactical acumen, endless energy and technical proficiency was not only crucial in La Albiceleste’s first glory on the global stage since 1986; it also won him the FIFA Young Player Award.
