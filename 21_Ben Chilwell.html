<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">An England international who likes to attack from left-back, contributing with assists and the occasional goal, Chilwell is equally adept at the defensive side of the game. He is a modern full-back in every sense of the phrase, combining athleticism and energy up and down the flank with excellent technique and the ability to recover with pace in defensive transition.
<br><br>
As the role of the full-back has evolved in recent years, Chilwell has emerged as a player who can contribute in every area of the field. His left-footedness provides balance to the team and his eagerness to attack is facilitated by being assured in possession and reliable with deliveries into the box or penetrative passes forward.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>After a delayed start due to injury, Chilwell’s first season with Chelsea began with a bang on a brilliant debut as he quickly adapted to life at Stamford Bridge to become one of our best performers during the first part of the campaign.
<br><br>
He needed a second period of adaptation after our change of manager and system, but showed almost weekly improvement as he got to grips with the wing-back role and his importance to both Frank Lampard and Thomas Tuchel is demonstrated by the fact that only two outfield players started more Premier League games for Chelsea than Chilwell in 2020/21.
<br><br>
<img src="media file/player/villa_home_chilwell.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  	<br><br>	  
Chilly was a standout performer in Chelsea's Champions League winning run - who could forget that goal against Porto! - and the left-back was rarely seen without a smile on his face during his first season with the Blues in 2020/21.
<br><br>
After missing our first three games with a foot injury, Chilwell was eased into the action in Carabao Cup games against Barnsley and Tottenham. It turned out that problem was an ongoing one, which needed managing in the months ahead, but you wouldn’t have known from the left-back’s performances.
<br><br>
He’d been on the pitch less than 20 minutes in the first of those games when he claimed an assist with a cross from deep to Olivier Giroud. Even better was to follow on his Premier League debut against Crystal Palace, as he opened the scoring himself before setting up Kurt Zouma for the second in a 4-0 win. Four games into his Blues career, Chilwell’s one goal and three assists gave him more goal involvements than any other Premier League defender.
<br><br>
It wasn’t just on the ball he was impressing, either, showing his defensive prowess by helping Chelsea to keep seven clean sheets in his first nine games, further demonstrating how quickly he had settled in west London when he was nominated for Premier League Player of the Month in November.
<br><br>
Chilwell’s link-up play with Mason Mount was a crucial part of many of our best team performances during the first half of the season, with an excellent example coming against Aston Villa at Christmas, when an intricate passing move began with Chilwell taking the ball from Edouard Mendy on the edge of his own box, and ended up with him setting up Giroud to score in the other area.

</p>
	  </div>
		<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Ben Chilwell had to be patient at the start of the 2021/22 season, as a period isolating as a precaution due to Covid-19 while on international duty with England, combined with a lack of playing time and late return for pre-season following Euro 2020, meant he was playing catch-up with his fitness while Marcos Alonso began the campaign as Tuchel's preferred option on the left.
<br><br>
However, when his chance arrived he took it with both hands, scoring on his first Premier League start of the season to complete a 3-1 win over Southampton. Chilwell provided key attacking width and a constant threat in the opposition box as we hit top form in the weeks that followed, and he found the net against Brentford and Norwich City to make it three goals in four starts.
<br><br>
It was doubly disappointing then that a serious knee injury suffered in a 4-0 Champions League thrashing of Juventus in late November forced him to spend almost the whole of the rest of the campaign watching on from the sidelines, just as he had been hitting his peak. He made his return in the final minutes of the final game of the season.</p>
	  </div>
	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Chilwell had only made his comeback from an ACL injury on the final day of 2021/22, so his return to regular action was carefully managed by Thomas Tuchel in the early parts of the next campaign.
<br><br>
He started the league opener at Everton and won the penalty from which Jorginho scored the only goal, but was unused in our next game and then came off the bench in the subsequent four league fixtures.
<br><br>
Chilwell completed the win at Crystal Palace as the Blues, now under the guidance of Graham Potter, started to see the best of the left wing-back again. Frustratingly, though, Chilwell picked up a bad hamstring injury right at the end of our Champions League victory at home to Dinamo Zagreb, ruling him out of the World Cup.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Chilwell was born in Milton Keynes in December 1996 and initially played for Rushden & Diamonds until the age of 12 before signing for Leicester’s youth programme. He progressed steadily through the age groups, albeit not always comfortably, and has admitted he feared being released at the age of 15 following a difficult season.
<br><br>
However, the defender persevered and was soon catching the eye with performances in the youth team and Under-21s. He played against Chelsea at those age groups on numerous occasions, going up against the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham in clashes between the two sides. His first team debut for the Foxes came in a League Cup tie at Hull City, with Claudio Ranieri playing him from the start, and then two further FA Cup appearances that season followed. Sandwiched in between was a short loan spell at Huddersfield Town, where he made eight appearances in the Championship.
<br><br>
That 2015/16 campaign ended in unbelievable fashion at the King Power Stadium as Leicester did the unthinkable and were crowned Premier League champions, though it wasn’t until the following season that Chilwell made his league debut against Everton on Boxing Day, five days after his 20th birthday. He featured in the Champions League for the first time in 2016/17 as Leicester topped their group before going out in the quarter-finals to Atletico Madrid. His first senior goal came against Tottenham in the penultimate game of the campaign.
<br><br>
The defender’s breakthrough season came the following year as he made 32 appearances, although he was sent off on a visit to Stamford Bridge in January 2018 in a 0-0 draw after picking up two quick bookings. Nevertheless, Chilwell’s standing grew further as he established himself as Leicester’s first-choice left-back before making his international debut at the start of the 2018/19 season.
<br><br>
He featured in all but two of Leicester’s Premier League fixtures that season and was once again a regular during the interrupted 2019/20 term, scoring the first in the Foxes’ record-breaking 9-0 win at Southampton in October and firing in a brilliant late equaliser in their first game of the restart against Watford. Chilwell also netted against Chelsea at the start of February in a 2-2 draw between the sides.
</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Chilwell represented England at every age group from the Under-18s up before making his senior debut for Gareth Southgate’s side in a friendly held in Leicester against Switzerland in September 2018. He made his first start a month later in a Nations League goalless draw in Croatia. He was a regular for the remainder of that Nations League campaign as England finished third in the finals.
<br><br>
<img src="media file/player/Chilwell_England_2018_GettyImages-1031590116.jpg" width="1400" height="933" alt=""/>
	<br><br>	  
The left-back also featured frequently in qualifying for Euro 2020, recording three assists in one game as the Three Lions thrashed Montenegro 7-0 at Wembley, and was named in England's squad for the delayed tournament itself, although he remained unused on their run to final.</p>
