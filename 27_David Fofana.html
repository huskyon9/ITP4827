<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">The Ivorian’s combination of pace, skill and strength make him a versatile striker, capable of scoring goals but especially adept at holding up the ball and retaining possession under pressure.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>David Fofana started his football career in the capital of his homeland the Ivory Coast, with Abidjan City, before catching the eye at the Amadou Diallo Football Academy, where he showed himself to be one of the African game’s most promising teenage talents.
<br><br>
The 18-year-old’s chosen destination when making the move abroad at the start of 2021 was the Norwegian first division and Molde and he made an instant impact in Norway, scoring an important and dramatic goal on his debut, just two weeks after completing his transfer at the start of February 2021.
<br><br>
		    <img src="media file/player/Datro_Fofana_celeb_Molde_Hoffenheim_GettyImages-1302868223.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
He was introduced as a substitute in the first leg of a Europa League knockout tie against Hoffenheim with his side trailing 3-1 and 25 minutes remaining, playing his part in an impressive comeback by scoring the equaliser 10 minutes after coming on.
<br><br>
Due to the summer season in Norway, the young striker had to wait until May for his next chance to impress, again coming off the bench on the opening day of the league campaign, before being handed his first start in a home loss to Valerenga. That proved to be his only league start of the 2021 season for a Molde side which finished second in the Eliteserien, although he was a frequent substitute.
<br><br>
It was a different story in the 2021/22 Norwegian FA Cup, though, in Molde’s victorious run. He registered two goals and two assists in three starts during the early rounds of the competition, most notably when providing one of each in another incredible comeback, this time against fellow top-flight side Odds in the last 16. Following a 1-1 draw, Molde found themselves trailing 2-1 with less than five minutes of extra time left, when Fofana slotted in to equalise before, just two minutes later, his own cross produced a dramatic winner.
<br><br>
Fofana had clearly done enough for a more prominent role in the team as he started both of their first two league games in 2022. The striker continued his penchant for the dramatic with his first league goal in Norway, netting the winner in a 2-1 victory less than two minutes after the home side had scored a second-half equaliser. It was the first of six he would score in as many league games, helping propel his side into title contention.
<br><br>
Fofana finished 2022 with another impressive run of six goals in as many games as an increasingly dominant Molde secured the Eliteserien title by a comfortable margin. Overall he managed a healthy total of 15 goals in 24 league appearances for the season, making him Molde's highest scorer, in addition to four Europa Conference League goals.

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Fofana’s form for Molde in 2022 earned him full international recognition with the Ivory Coast, when he featured from the start of the country’s 4-0 friendly win over Burundi in November, the first of two caps he earned that month.
<br><br>
His only previous senior international involvement had come at the age of just 16, when he received a solitary cap in September 2019 for a qualifying match against Niger in the African Nations Championship, a continental competition for which only those playing club football in their native domestic leagues are eligible.</p>
