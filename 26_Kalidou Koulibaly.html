<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">Widely regarded as one of the best centre-backs in world football, the Senegalese possesses all the attributes an elite modern defender requires.
<br><br>
He is a great reader of the game, a goal threat, and also adept in possession, comfortable bringing the ball out or playing progressive passes to put his team on the attack.
<br><br>
The captain of Senegal, Koulibaly is a natural leader and a strong character. He has plenty of experience challenging for domestic and international titles.</p>

	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Kalidou Koulibaly made his Chelsea debut on the opening day of the 2022/23 campaign, a 1-0 win at Everton in which we restricted our opponents to very few chances.
<br><br>
He announced himself to the Stamford Bridge faithful on his first home outing a week later, emphatically volleying a corner past Hugo Lloris and into the Shed End net. He became the 24th player to score for Chelsea on their home Premier League debut.
<br><br>
<img src="media file/player/koulibaly-celebration-tottenham-home.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/> <br><br>
His third appearance did not go well for him or the team, as we lost heavily at Leeds with Koulibaly sent off late on for two bookable offences.
<br><br>
He returned to the side for another away defeat, at Southampton, and remained a regular presence in our defence until the World Cup break, where he helped Senegal reach the last-16 with the winning goal against Ecuador.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born in the north-east of France to Senegalese parents, Koulibaly’s footballing journey began with his amateur hometown club SR Saint-Die. Days after his 18th birthday he joined Ligue 2 side Metz, where he starred in a successful youth team before making the step up to the senior squad ahead of the 2010/11 campaign. He finished that season a regular in the side, totalling 19 appearances and scoring his first professional goal against Clermont as Metz narrowly avoided relegation.
<br><br>
Although Metz could not escape relegation in 2011/12, it was another season of impressive development for Koulibaly, who even captained the side aged just 20 in a win at Monaco. Other clubs in Europe were starting to pay attention, and it was Genk who secured his services in June 2012.
<br><br>
Koulibaly thrived during his two years in Belgium. He sampled European football for the first time, making 18 appearances in the Europa League as Genk reached the knockout stages in both seasons, and won the Belgian Cup in 2013. Koulibaly was prominent as Standard Liege, Anderlecht and Cercle Bruges were all beaten en route to glory, Genk only conceding once when he was on the pitch.
<br><br>
He showcased his versatility, too, notably used in a defensive midfield role in a win over Sporting Lisbon, and more often at right-back, a position Napoli have also deployed him in. Koulibaly accumulated a healthy 92 appearances at Genk before departing for Serie A.
<br><br>
Naples has been Koulibaly’s home for the past eight years, and such is the standing in which he is held in the city he was made an honorary citizen in 2019. Known as a promoter of social justice and fervent campaigner against racism, particularly in the wake of racist abuse he received in Italy, Koulibaly has also done vital work in Senegal to help underprivileged children.
<br><br>
On the pitch, Koulibaly has proven one of Napoli’s greatest foreign imports. A regular throughout his eight seasons, he amassed 317 appearances and scored 14 goals. Koulibaly has been a major factor in the Azzurri establishing themselves as genuine title challengers in Italy, coming as close as they ever have to winning Serie A for the first time since the days of Diego Maradona and a young Gianfranco Zola.
<br><br>
Koulibaly’s maiden year in Naples included an Italian Super Cup win over Juventus, in which he scored the decisive penalty, and a genuine tilt at the Europa League as Rafa Benitez’s side reached the semi-finals.
<br><br>
The arrival of another former Chelsea boss, Maurizio Sarri, took Koulibaly’s game onto a new level. Given extra responsibility in possession, Koulibaly was encouraged to bring the ball out of defence. He took to the role admirably, named in the Serie A Team of the Year for 2015/16.
<br><br>
He would receive that accolade in each of the next three years, too, culminating in being voted Serie A’s best defender in 2019. For the second season running Napoli, now under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti, just missed out on the title to Juventus, but Koulibaly was a near ever-present and stood out with his strength, speed, anticipation and assuredness in possession.
<br><br>
Napoli’s wait for the silverware their talented squad deserved ended in June 2020 when they beat Juventus on penalties in the Coppa Italia final following a goalless draw in which Koulibaly was immense.
<br><br>
Like so many in the past two seasons, Covid-19 and injury meant Koulibaly’s appearance figures slightly dropped, but he still played 71 games for Napoli in that time.
