<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">The experienced forward became the sixth senior signing of the summer window to bolster our men’s squad following a seven-month stay at Camp Nou. He scored 13 goals in 23 appearances for Barca the previous season, helping them rise from sixth in La Liga when he joined in February to finish as runners-up.
<br><br>
A pacy striker and clinical finisher, the 33-year-old is a proven Premier League goalscorer having netted 68 times for Arsenal over four years at the Emirates, averaging better than a goal every two games in all competitions and sharing the Golden Boot award in 2018/19 alongside Liverpool duo Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.
<br><br>
He won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2020, adding to trophies collected with Borussia Dortmund in Germany and Saint-Etienne in France.</p>

	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Aubameyang had a delayed start to his Chelsea career, due to a broken jaw suffered prior to his arrival in west London, which also required him to wear a protective mask when he did make his debut, in the Champions League defeat at Dinamo Zagreb which was Thomas Tuchel’s final match as head coach.
<br><br>
His Premier League debut for Chelsea went smoother, though, as he showed his striker’s instincts to brilliantly swivel in the box and fire his first Blues goal into the bottom corner, netting our equaliser as we came from behind to win 2-1 at Crystal Palace.
<br><br>
He followed that up with further goals home and away against his former club AC Milan in the Champions League, the second giving Chelsea our first-ever victory at the San Siro, to make it three goals in as many appearances.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made his name in European football at Borussia Dortmund, where he was first coached by Thomas Tuchel and spent four-and-a-half years in total, firing Die Schwarzgelben to domestic cup success in the DFB Pokal in 2016/17 under the Bavarian’s charge.

That term also saw him finish as the Bundesliga top goalscorer with 31 goals, and 40 in all competitions his best-ever return to date, with his eye-catching strike rate ultimately earning a move to the Premier League midway through the following season.

The forward was voted Bundesliga Player of the Year in 2015/16, as chosen by fellow players, as Dortmund finished closer to Bayern Munich than at any time during his spell in Germany, again with Tuchel in the dug-out.
<br><br>
There was trophy success in the DFL-Supercup, the 2013 edition a rematch of the previous spring’s Champions League final, with Dortmund’s newly-signed striker making his mark with an assist in a 4-2 win over Bayern, before grabbing both a goal and an assist a year later in the same competition.
<br><br>
He also netted a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut to quickly endear himself with the Yellow Wall. Aubameyang’s time in Germany was clinical and colourful, his celebratory acrobatics a regular sight as he notched almost 150 goals and left as one of Europe’s elite goalscorers.
<br><br>
Prior to his signing at Dortmund in the summer of 2013, Aubameyang spent five seasons in France, initially on loan from AC Milan before turning a temporary move to Saint-Etienne permanent in late 2011.
<br><br>
<img src="media file/player/Aubameyang_Lille.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/> He quickly established a reputation as an accomplished marksman in Ligue 1, finishing among the highest goalscorers in both 2011/12 and 2012/13, while claiming the first major trophy of his career in the Coupe de la Ligue.
<br><br>
Following his successful spell in Germany, Arsenal came calling and Aubameyang moved to north London for a then club-record fee paid by the Gunners. It was a mid-season switch and the striker scored on his debut and the goals continued to flow.
<br><br>
His first full campaign in the Premier League ended with him the competition’s joint top scorer and his maiden Gunners hat-trick ensured safe passage past Valencia in the Europa League semi-final.
<br><br>
As starting striker in the final in Baku, he finished on the wrong end of a 4-1 defeat by Chelsea but his revenge would come at the pandemic-delayed end to the following campaign. The 2020 FA Cup final inside an empty Wembley was going the Blues’ way before Aubameyang netted a penalty having been fouled himself. He then scored a second-half winner in open play.
<br><br>
The season that led up to that silverware yielded 22 goals for the second season running and he also assumed the Arsenal captaincy.
<br><br>
His following season-and-a-half at the Emirates proved less successful but most recently at Barcelona, Aubameyang had an instant impact in reviving fortunes under Xavi, a hat-trick on his maiden La Liga start against Valencia the beginning of a run of nine goals in eight games in all competitions.
<br><br>
Two of those came in a big win at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid in April, while another two were part of Barca’s run to the Europa League quarter-finals.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>On the international stage, Aubameyang chose to represent Gabon and played 72 times for the Panthers, including at the 2012 Olympics in London and the Africa Cup of Nations. His 30 goals make him Gabon’s all-time top goalscorer. He has retired from international football.</p>
