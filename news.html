<div class="news-content">
      <p>21/04/2023<br><br>Chelsea Women are back on the European stage with a blockbuster UEFA Women’s Champions League semi-final first leg encounter against Barcelona at Stamford Bridge on Saturday lunchtime.

We secured our place in next month’s FA Cup final with a 1-0 victory over Aston Villa last weekend and the focus shifts quickly to our European exploits, where we take on Barcelona across two legs in the race to reach the final in Eindhoven.

Our semi-final spot was secured in dramatic fashion as we overcame Lyon, eight-time winners of the tournament, on penalties at Stamford Bridge in the quarter-finals. Maren Mjelde’s 128th-minute spot-kick sent the game to a shoot-out where Ann-Katrin Berger made two fine saves at the Shed End.</p></p>
