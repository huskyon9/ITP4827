<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">He became a member of the Chelsea squad for the start of the 2019/20 season. An agreement was first reached in January 2019 for his permanent transfer from Borussia Dortmund but spent the remainder of that season on loan at the German club.
<br><br>
He joined Chelsea on a five-and-a-half year contract and became the third American player in our history after his international team-mate, Matt Miazga, and Roy Wegerle.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> 2019/2020 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Pulisic made his Chelsea debut as a sub in the defeat to Manchester United, and his first start followed a few days later as we were beaten by Liverpool on penalties in the Super Cup. He set up Olivier Giroud's opener and had a goal of his own ruled out for offside.
<br><br>
He started our next three leagues games before losing his place in the team for a while. Following the October international break, he played decisive passes in tight wins over Newcastle and Ajax having been brought off the bench. He was rewarded with a start at Burnley in our next league outing and responded in style, scoring a perfect hat-trick.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/burnley-away-2019-003.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  <br><br>
Full of confidence and incisiveness, Pulisic's knack for scoring or setting up goals showed no sign of relenting, as he displayed predatory instincts to net in wins over Watford and Crystal Palace. His dribbling skills also earned us a penalty in the 4-4 epic against Ajax and his first Champions League goal for the club helped secure a crucial draw at Valencia.
<br><br>
He had become a regular in the starting line-up by the end of 2019, but a combination of injury and the suspension of football during the Covid-19 pandemic meant he didn’t play between New Year’s Day and the first game of the restart in mid-June. His form was worth the wait, though, as he opened the scoring in our first two games of the restart, wins over Aston Villa and Manchester City.
<br><br>
He finished his first campaign in England as arguably Chelsea and the Premier League’s form player, underlined when he became the first American to score in an FA Cup final as he again got the first goal of the game, against Arsenal at Wembley. However, an injury meant an early end to his match and we struggled to maintain the same incisive attacks in his absence, as we missed out on finishing the season with a trophy.
</p>

<div class="team-content">
      <p>The hamstring injury Pulisic sustained in the FA Cup final in our final game of 2019/20 ruled him out until the sixth fixture of the new campaign, when he came on as a late sub in a big home win over Crystal Palace.
<br><br>
A spate of appearances followed, and a first goal of the season away to Krasnodar, too, but then after feeling his hamstring in the warm-up at Burnley he was removed from the starting line-up. He was ruled out for another month.
<br><br>
In his second game back, against Leeds, he scored the game-sealing goal late on in front of a small crowd at the Bridge, and his fitness remained good for the rest of the season.
<br><br>
Lampard had used him on the right or left of the front three, but when his former Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel arrived in January, Pulisic more often than not found himself further infield in more of a 3-4-2-1 shape, initially used largely as an impact sub.
<br><br>
Having come off the bench, he set up the second goal of Tuchel’s reign, Marcos Alonso’s brilliant effort against Burnley, and Emerson’s breakaway strike at home to Atletico Madrid in March.
<br><br>
April brought three league goals in two games, West Brom and Crystal Palace his victims, with one of his strikes at Selhurst Park a near-replica of another lockdown effort in south London.
<br><br>
By this stage of the season he was hitting the heights he managed at the tail-end of the previous one, starting more often, and showcased his ability in the Champions League, too. In the ‘home’ leg against Porto, he was named man of the match having almost single-handedly taken the attack to our physical Portuguese opponents, drawing an astonishing 11 fouls, the most in a single game in the competition in the previous five years.
<br><br>
Then he netted a calm solo effort away to Real Madrid having sat Thibaut Courtois down. He did likewise in the second leg before teeing up Mason Mount to guarantee our place in Porto.</p>

<div class="team-content">
      <p>Pulisic had to be patient at the start of 2022/23, with 13 of his 18 appearances before the winter World Cup break coming as a substitute, but he showed his ability to make an impact when called upon, from the bench or the start.
<br><br>
That was clear when the American was brought on by Graham Potter with six minutes remaining of our Premier League visit to Crystal Palace, before setting up Conor Gallagher’s spectacular late winner.
<br><br>
His first two starts under Potter also produced a goal and an assist, scoring our second in a 3-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers and teeing up Kai Havertz for another stunning winning goal, away against Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League group stage.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born in Hershey, Pennsylvania, he is the son of two former footballers, and spent time in England as a child, where he played with Northamptonshire side Brackley Town before moving back to the States.
<br><br>
With a number of European clubs monitoring his progress, Pulisic signed for Dortmund as a 16-year-old in early 2015, quickly rising through the academy ranks to make his senior debut a year later.
<br><br>
His first half-season in the Bundesliga provided nine appearances and two goals, and he became a regular under Thomas Tuchel during the 2016/17 campaign, adding more than 60 league appearances over the next two years.
<br><br>
A series of minor injuries limited Pulisic’s playing time in the 2018/19 season, but his goals included a Champions League winner at Club Brugge and one in his final home game for Dortmund that helped take their ultimately unsuccessful Bundesliga challenge into the final day.  
</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>A USA international who also holds a Croatian passport, Pulisic was voted his country’s Player of the Year in 2017, and was their star player in the CONCACAF Gold Cup in the summer of 2019 shortly before he joined up with the Chelsea squad. The States reached the final where they were beaten by Mexico. Pulisic was named the Young Player of the Tournament.
<br><br>
In the summer of 2021, Pulisic was the hero for the United States as they dramatically came from behind to beat Mexico 3-2 after extra-time in the final of the inaugural CONCACAF Nations League.
<br><br>
The Chelsea attacker scored the fifth and decisive goal of a thrilling encounter from the penalty spot with six minutes of the additional 30 remaining.
<br><br>
He then netted his first-ever USA hat-trick in a 5-1 victory against Panama in March 2022, a trio of strikes which all but ensured their qualification to the 2022 World Cup.
<br><br>
The winger played a vital role in the tournament itself, too, showing plenty of bravery in scoring the only goal of the game as the USA beat Iran 1-0 to secure a place in the knock-out stages, as well as setting up their first goal of the World Cup in a 1-1 draw with Wales, and their last in the defeat to the Netherlands in the last 16.</p>
