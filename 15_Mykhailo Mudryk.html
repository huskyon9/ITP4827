<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">The Ukrainian international turned 22 a couple of weeks before putting pen to paper on his eight-and-a-half year contract with the Blues.
<br><br>
A skillful player with plenty of pace, Mudryk quickly built a reputation as one of the most dangerous attacking players in Europe in one-v-one situations during his time with Shakhtar Donetsk. Primarily a wide player, he featured on both wings in Ukraine, but many of his best performances have come when cutting in from the left onto his preferred right foot.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Having been born in the Ukrainian city of Krasnograd, not far from Kharkiv, the young Mykhailo Mudryk spent his formative football years in the academy at local club Metalist Kharkiv. In 2014, at the age of 13, he switched to the larger outfit of Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, before being spotted by Shakhtar Donetsk and joining them two years later.
<br><br>
At the age of 17, Mudryk was handed a first-team debut in a Ukrainian Cup match, a 3-2 win over local rivals Olimpik Donetsk, his only appearance in a competition Shakhtar would win that season. The next step was a loan move – to Arsenal Kyiv where the teenager had his first taste of league football.
<br><br>
In 2019/20, back at Shakhtar, Mudryk predominantly played development football, but did contribute three appearances to a successful Ukraine league championship-winning campaign by the senior side.
<br><br>
After a loan to Desna Chernigiv for 2020/21, which added a further 10 league appearances to his growing experience, the time had come to establish himself at his parent club.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/Mykhailo_Mudryk_Shakhtar_vs_Real_Madrid.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  <br><br>
That happened in earnest when Roberto De Zerbi took over as Shakhtar manager in May 2021. Mudryk scored his first goal in a 5-0 league win over Mariupol in October 2021 and featured in every Champions League group-stage game that season, including matches against Real Madrid and Inter Milan.
<br><br>
He was a regular in the domestic league, although it was a competition that was ultimately terminated due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Mudryk was named the Shakhtar Donetsk Player of the Year for 2021, an honour repeated the following year when he was also named Ukraine’s Footballer of the Year for 2022.
<br><br>
In 2022/23, before his mid-season move to Chelsea, Mudryk opened Shakhtar’s Champions League campaign with a goal and two assists in a 4-1 away win at RB Leipzig. He also found the net home and away in 1-1 draws with Celtic, while he was a regular scorer in Ukraine’s Premier Liga, netting six times in his final eight appearances for the club.
<br><br>
In total in his time with Shakhtar, Mudryk scored 12 goals in 44 appearances, including three in the Champions League.
</p>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Mudryk was first capped at Under-16 level by his nation while progressing in the Shakhtar Donetsk development system.
<br><br>
For Ukraine’s senior side he was handed his international debut as a substitute in a qualification play-off for the Qatar World Cup, in a win against Scotland in last June.
<br><br>
That was soon followed by another sub appearance when they were eliminated by Wales, before a first start in the UEFA Nations League against the Republic of Ireland, receiving eight caps in total during 2022.</p>
