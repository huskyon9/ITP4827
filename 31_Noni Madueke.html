<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">Chukwunonso Tristan Madueke, to give him his full name, had built a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young talents during his time in the Netherlands and penned a seven-and-a-half-year contract at Chelsea, with a club option to extend for a further year.
<br><br>
A skilful, creative, direct-running and rapid left-footed attacking player, he can play through the middle but is more regularly seen out wide, often on the right.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Noni Madueke was born in the north London suburbs, in Barnet to be precise. He later lived and played junior football further out on that side of town, yet it was in south London where he first become involved with a professional football club, joining Crystal Palace at the age of nine.
<br><br>
Three years later he returned to the north of the capital when joining Tottenham’s academy where, having scored 25 goals in 22 games in his first season and become the Uner-16 team captain, he progressed to play in their Under-18s by the age of 15, before a big career change.
<br><br>
Against the backdrop of interest from other Premier League clubs, Madueke became one of the recent collection of young prospects from England to switch to another European league for the next step on the ladder.
<br><br>
	    <img src="media file/player/Noni_Madueke_PSV_U19s_2019.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  <br><br>
He moved to the Netherlands and one of their biggest clubs – signing a three-year contract with PSV in 2018. In Eindhoven, he went straight into the Under-19 side, where he was under the coaching wing of former PSV, Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.
<br><br>
Madueke’s attacking impact in the 2019/20 season quickly won minutes for Jong PSV, their second string side which plays in the Dutch second tier. He scored four goals and supplied one assist in five starts.
<br><br>
During that same season, aged 17, he was also handed three substitute appearances for PSV’s first team, the second one against Ajax, before his full debut in March 2020. That was in a league game away against Groningen.
<br><br>
Season 2020/21 was the real breakthrough for the teenager. He played 32 times, including 24 appearances in the Eredivisie and seven in the Europa League. His first goal for the senior side came in the second game of the season, a 2-1 win in September 2020 at home to Emmen.
<br><br>
It was followed by eight more goals that campaign, including a brace against Den Haag and a first European goal at home to PAOK. Madueke also assisted for eight goals that season and earned praise for his hard work.
<br><br>
In 2021/22 there were two goals in Champions League qualifiers and nine overall, plus six assists, in 35 appearances. A big highlight was a double strike in a 4-0 hammering of Ajax in the Johan Cruyff Shield, the Netherlands’ equivalent of the Community Shield.
<br><br>
Injury ruled Madueke out of an appearance in another trophy win over the Amsterdam club at the end of the season, in the Dutch Cup, but he had scored and assisted in the quarter-final against Breda and played in the semi.
<br><br>
Madueke endured a delayed start to his last campaign in the Netherlands due to an ankle injury but, back under the management of Van Nistelrooy, who had taken over the first-team reins, Madueke returned in October and scored in his third game back.
<br><br>
In total, Madueke made 80 appearances for PSV, scoring 20 goals, 11 in the Dutch league, with an assists total of 14, before leaving for Chelsea midway through the 2022/23 season.
