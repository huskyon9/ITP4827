<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">It was in the latter role he has established himself as a senior professional, growing into an intelligent box-to-box midfielder with a knack for arriving in the opposition penalty area to create and score goals.</p>

	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Gallagher's only previous senior competitive involvement for Chelsea had been as an unused substitute in the 2019 Europa League final victory over Arsenal in Baku, but he didn't have to wait long for his debut after being included in the first-team squad for 2022/23.
<br><br> 
It arrived as a late substitute in our opening game of the season, a 1-0 win away at Everton in the Premier League. His first start came later in August, away at Leeds United, but our next match saw him sent off for two first-half bookings, as we beat Leicester City on his first start at Stamford Bridge.
<br><br> 
However, once Gallagher returned from suspension he featured in all but two of Chelsea’s remaining matches in all competitions before the World Cup break, including all five Champions League fixtures under Graham Potter.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/gallagher-goal-palace-a.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
He scored his first senior goal for Chelsea at the start of October, fittingly on his return to Selhurst Park, where he had impressed on loan with Crystal Palace the previous season. It was in equal parts dramatic, spectacular and important, as he brilliantly curled a shot into the top corner from outside the box to seal a 2-1 comeback win over Palace in the 90th minute.

</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Academy ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>He has a couple of brothers who have been scholars at other clubs so comes from a football family who are big Chelsea supporters. A development centre graduate, he has been training with Chelsea since the age of six and is a team player with a great attitude.
<br><br> 
He made 31 appearances in his first season as a scholar, including two as a substitute in the Youth Cup, and made his development squad debut in March 2017. Among his five goals for the Under-18s, he crucially broke the deadlock in our title decider against Reading, kicking off the Cobham celebrations.
<br><br> 
The midfielder continued to feature predominantly for our youth team throughout 2017/18, contributing to another unprecedented trophy haul, including playing in every game as the FA Youth Cup was retained once again.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> On loan ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>In October 2018, Gallagher signed a new contract at the club that ran until the summer of 2021. After being handed the Academy Player of the Year award after the 2018/19 season, the midfielder joined Charlton Athletic on loan.
<br><br> 
In January 2020 he returned from struggling Charlton, having missed just one Championship game and scored six goals from midfield. He switched loans to another Championship club, Swansea City, who were challenging for the play-offs. There he linked up with fellow Chelsea Academy graduate Marc Guehi, who made the loan move to South Wales a week earlier, as well as Steve Cooper, the England Under-17 manager who had the pair in his team when the young Lions won the World Cup at that age group in 2017.
<br><br> 
With the Swans, Gallagher dramatically secured a Championship play-off spot on the last day of the regular season, but despite Swansea having the advantage at the end of the first leg of the semi-finals, Brentford advanced to the Wembley final, winning 3-2 on aggregate. The midfielder ended the season with a total of 21 games for the Welsh side.
<br><br> 
After an impressive season in the Championship, Gallagher signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea and earned a chance at Premier League football with West Bromwich Albion. Ever-present in their midfield, he made 32 outings and scored two goals in 2,683 minutes of football. Although West Brom would end the 2020/21 season in 19th place, meaning they were relegated, Gallagher's performances earned him the award of Young Player of the Year for the club.
<br><br> 
Gallagher stayed in the Premier League for 2021/22, this time on a season-long loan across London at Crystal Palace. He was one of the first names on the team sheet right from the beginning at Selhurst Park, with all but two of his 39 appearances coming from the start. His six goals and three assists in the Premier League by December was the most of any player aged 21 or under.
<br><br> 
He netted twice more in the second half of the campaign, meaning he was involved in 22 per cent of Palace's league goals, in addition to helping them reach the FA Cup semi-finals, unsurprisingly being named the club's Player of the Year for 2021/22.
	</p>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>A late addition to the England Under-17 squad, he made his debut prior to the U17 World Cup finals in October 2017 and returned with a winner's medal, featuring regularly as a steadying influence in midfield in the latter stages of games, including the final.
<br><br> 
His form on loan at Crystal Palace resulted in a first senior international call-up for England, making his debut as a half-time substitute in a 10-0 thrashing of San Marino in World Cup qualifying in November 2021. His first start arrived in a friendly with Switzerland in March 2022, when Gallagher set-up Luke Shaw's equaliser as the Three Lions came from behind to win 2-1.
<br><br> 
Following two further caps, including a first competitive start against Hungary in the UEFA Nations League, Gallagher was named in Gareth Southgate's England squad for the 2022 World Cup. The midfielder was an unused substitute in all five of the Three Lions' games in Qatar as they reached the quarter-finals.
