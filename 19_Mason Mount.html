<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">He has always been an attacking midfielder, capable of playing in any of the central midfield roles and is particularly strong at going from box to box.</p>
<button class="team-menu"> 2019/2020 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>After going to the European Under-21 Championship with England in the summer of 2019, Mount returned to Chelsea and signed a new five-year contract.
<br><br>
He started the season in the team under Frank Lampard, making his Chelsea debut and impressing against Manchester United despite an eventual heavy defeat. He marked his first appearance at the Bridge by opening the scoring early on, and he followed up that maiden strike with another away to Norwich the following weekend.
<br><br>
Mount scored his third Chelsea goal in four games late on in our big 5-2 win at Wolves, and it was soon clear that he would play just as important a role in Lampard’s team at the Bridge as he had during their season together at Derby, during a loan spell. He made more Premier League appearances than any other Chelsea player during 2019/20, with only Cesar Azpilicueta and Kepa Arrizabalaga playing more minutes in that competition.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/Mount-Everton-Home-21-22-GettyImages-1359405666.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
He went into the lockdown period when that season was interrupted in good form after opening the scoring in our last match in March against Everton, and showed plenty of end product when football resumed three months later. In particular his performance on the last day of the Premier League caught the eye, as he scored one and set up the other in the 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers which secured our Champions League qualification.
<br><br>
His goal against Wolves was a pinpoint free-kick, underlining the threat he carries from set-pieces, which also accounted for half of his six assists. With eight goals to his name too, only three Chelsea players were directly involved in more goals than Mount in 2019/20, and his 53 appearances in all competitions made him the first Academy graduate to play more than 50 games in his debut season with the senior side.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>His second season as a senior player at Stamford Bridge started brightly for the youngster, who didn’t turn 22 until the start of 2021. He played every minute of our opening five Premier League matches, scoring our first against West Brom as we came back to draw 3-3, before remaining an unused substitute for the victory over Crystal Palace in early October as he nursed an ankle knock.
<br><br>
That followed disappointment away at Tottenham when he missed the decisive penalty in a Carabao Cup shoot-out as we exited the competition in the fourth round.
<br><br>
Yet Mount’s durability shone through during a relentless autumn and winter schedule, and he was able to maintain a high level of performance even when results became more inconsistent. In fact, our number 19 featured in 12 straight matches through October and November, racking up three assists during that time.
<br><br>
His set-piece prowess was proving a useful threat for the Blues, with Kurt Zouma the beneficiary of two perfect corners in victories against Burnley and Leeds United. Meanwhile, there was more spontaneous craft behind an assist for Callum Hudson-Odoi away at Rennes as Mount fought for possession and then floated a delightful ball over the top for his Cobham comrade to tuck away. The midfielder’s contribution offered yet more evidence of both sides of his developing game.
<br><br>
The winter months were more difficult as points were dropped on the road and we slipped down the Premier League table, though it was Mount’s late strike away at Fulham that provided some punch and fight to a struggling side in mid-January. It proved to be our final league victory under Lampard.
<br><br>
The FA Cup provided some respite early in the calendar year and the midfielder opened the scoring in our third-round victory against Morecambe just a day after his 22nd birthday, before he was named captain in round four against Luton Town. Aged 22 years and 14 days, he became our youngest skipper since John Terry, and took the armband once again before the season's end, in the FA Cup quarter-final against Sheffield United.
<br><br>
After quickly winning favour under Tuchel, Mount remained a regular in the side, adapting to a new role in the Bavarian’s 3-4-2-1 system. His intelligent and intense pressing from the front won praise from the new boss, leading to him starting as a false nine with split strikers in our 1-0 win at Tottenham.
<br><br>
In the following match, away at the Blades, he opened the scoring with a smart left-footed finish from inside the box, taking his career Premier League goals tally into double figures. There was no looking back from there and the Portsmouth-born midfielder scored for the second successive season at Southampton, as well as crucial goals away to Liverpool and Porto.
<br><br>
It was undoubtedly his efforts on the big stage in Europe that stuck in the minds of Chelsea fans when they voted him their Player of the Year, particularly a memorable counter-attacking goal to seal our place in the final as Real Madrid were put to the sword at Stamford Bridge. In the first leg in the Spanish capital, Mount had made a milestone 100th Chelsea appearance.
<br><br>
To seal a hugely influential season in blue, it was his pass in the Champions League final that set Kai Havertz running clear for the only goal of the game. Class, character and composure, Mount demonstrated it all throughout a turbulent but triumphant campaign. He finished the season with 21 combined goals and assists, an output that played a big part in him being voted as Chelsea Player of the Year 2020/21 by supporters and nominated on the 30-player list for the 2021 Ballon d'Or.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>In his third season with the Chelsea senior squad, and now established as a key member of the team, Mason Mount continued to go from strength to strength at Stamford Bridge, being voted by supporters as the club’s Player of the Year for the second campaign in a row.
<br><br>
Whether in a wide attacking role, as a roaming No10 behind a pair of strikers, or occasionally as part of a midfield three, Mount’s importance to Thomas Tuchel’s side was underlined by the fact only one outfield player, Antonio Rudiger, made more appearances for the Blues in 2021/22.
<br><br>
Having ended 2020/21 by winning the Champions League, Mount lifted another trophy on his first appearance of 2021/22, when he started our UEFA Super Cup victory over Villarreal despite returning late for pre-season after helping England reach the Euro 2020 final over the summer.
<br><br>
He remained one of the first names on Tuchel's team sheet, with no outfield player making more appearances for the Blues in the first half of the campaign, most often as part of a front three as he posed an increasingly potent threat in the final third.
<br><br>
That was underlined in the 7-0 thrashing of Norwich City at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League when, having never scored more than once in a game for the Blues before, Mount netted his first Chelsea hat-trick, in addition to setting up Reece James for another.
<br><br>
The trend continued in early December, despite the team's form slipping during that period, as Mount found the back of the net in four consecutive Premier League games, including a brilliant volley away at West Ham that underlined his technical prowess.
<br><br>
2022 started well, too, as he set up Cesar Azpilicueta's equaliser against Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup fourth round, continuing our push for silverware on all fronts, but a badly timed ankle injury meant he was only able to appear briefly at the FIFA Club World Cup.
<br><br>
He still played an important part in Chelsea lifting that trophy for the first time, though, as he came on to help settle the ship when we were under pressure late in the semi-final, and was arguably the best player on the pitch in the opening stages of the final before that injury forced him off in the first half.
<br><br>
Those injury concerns were soon behind Mount, though, allowing him to put in several eye-catching performances at crucial stages of the season. That included a stand-out role in arguably the Blues’ best showing of the campaign, as the Portsmouth native scored twice and set-up another just down the coast in a 6-0 thrashing of Southampton, as we bounced back from consecutive defeats in style.
<br><br>
It started a brilliant run of games for our No19, as another goal and assist followed as we came within a whisker of overturning a first leg deficit in the Champions League quarter-finals at Real Madrid and then he completed the scoring in the FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal Palace at Wembley.
<br><br>
Although he was on the losing side in both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup finals, suffering the pain of seeing his penalty saved in the latter’s decisive shoot-out, Mount had done as much as anyone to get us to those two showpiece games and was influential again when we travelled to Leeds United in the Premier League, scoring the opening goal before creating Christian Pulisic’s second in a 3-0 victory which went a long way to ensuring we would finish the campaign third in the table.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Mount again started the 2022/23 season as an ever-present for the Blues – for both Thomas Tuchel and his replacement as head coach Graham Potter – featuring in all 21 of our matches in all competitions before the winter break for the World Cup, the only player to do so, while his 18 starts were also the most of anyone at Chelsea.
<br><br>
Some of his best performances during that first part of the season came in the Champions League group stage, where he provided four assists in the five games in that competition under Potter, including for both goals as we won 2-0 away against AC Milan, in Chelsea’s first-ever victory at the San Siro.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/mount-celebration-villa-away.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
He was in top form in mid-October, as that trip to Italy was sandwiched between two Premier League ties against Midlands sides. Mount assisted a further two goals as we beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Stamford Bridge in the first of those, before scoring both himself to give us a 2-0 victory away at Aston Villa, making it an impressive four assists and two goals for Mount in three games.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Academy ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>He played seven times for our Under-18s in 2014/15 when still a schoolboy and, despite picking up an injury on the first day of pre-season training, Mount's debut campaign as a scholar was a positive one.
<br><br>
He netted in our 5-1 win at Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup and played a pivotal role as a substitute in both the semi-final and final of our triumphant UEFA Youth League defence in April, setting up two goals in the 3-0 last-four win over Anderlecht. Later in the week, he scored a crucial goal in the first leg of the Youth Cup final away at Manchester City as we successfully defended the trophy.
<br><br>
2016/17 saw Mount establish himself as a regular with the development squad, scoring his first goal at that level against Liverpool in August. He also captained the Youth Cup side to a fourth consecutive success, netting a hat-trick in our fourth-round win at Birmingham. The midfielder's eye-catching displays earned him plenty of admirers and he rounded off an impressive campaign by setting up the winner in the final as England won the Under-19 European Championship.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> On loan ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>He moved to Vitesse Arnhem on loan for the 2017/18 season and enjoyed a year to remember in Holland. His 14 goals were integral in helping Vitesse qualify for the Europa League, and he featured impressively in that competition early in the campaign, too. Deployed either in central midfield or a number-10 role, Mount's creativity and finishing ability stood out to such an extent he was named Vitesse's Player of the Year. He finished the season by training with the England senior squad ahead of the World Cup.
<br><br>
In July 2018, he moved on loan to Championship side Derby County, managed by Lampard and his former youth-team boss Jody Morris. The midfielder was an integral part of the way Lampard’s Derby played, pressing from the front with intelligence and industry, while also demonstrating guile and quality on the ball. He only turned 20 midway through the season but finished with 16 goals and assists combined as the Rams fell 90 minutes short of promotion to the Premier League. Tellingly, his injury absence through February and March coincided with Derby winning just two of 10 matches.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Mount’s impressive start to life in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2019/20 saw him make his senior England debut at Wembley, coming off the bench in a 4-0 win over Bulgaria in a Euro 2020 qualifier. So quickly did he take to the international scene that he went on to feature in every subsequent match in that successful qualifying campaign, scoring his first international goal in a 4-0 win over Kosovo.
<br><br>
He established himself as a key part of the England team by the start of the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, and played every minute of their opening two group games to book their place in the knockout stages. However, the need to self-isolate under Covid rules meant he missed the next two games, but picked up where he left off on his return by setting up the last of four goals in a big win over Ukraine and started every subsequent match as the Three Lions reached the final before losing on penalties to Italy.
<br><br>
Mount continued to be a very regular starter for Gareth Southgate's team in the World Cup qualification and Nations League campaigns that followed. He netted against Hungary and Andorra in the quest to make Qatar.
<br><br>
He was named in the England squad for the 2022 World Cup itself, starting the first two group games as they thrashed Iran 6-2 and drew 0-0 with the USA. He then came on as a substitute in both knock-out games, as the Three Lions defeated Senegal in the last 16 and were beaten 2-1 by France in the quarter-finals, after a late penalty won by Mount was missed by captain Harry Kane.
