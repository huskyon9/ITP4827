<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">The transfer of the highly rated attacker from Bayer Leverkusen followed on from the purchase of his compatriot Timo Werner from another Bundesliga club, RB Leipzig, that same close season.
<br><br>
By that stage Havertz had become one of German football’s brightest prospects following his breakthrough at Bayer Leverkusen, setting a series of records for his achievements, including those for the youngest player to make 50 and 100 Bundesliga appearances, which were both previously held by Werner.
<br><br>
Tall, fast and technically excellent, he has shown impressive versatility given his age. Capable as an attacking midfielder known for his accurate and incisive passing, along with an ability to retain possession in tight spaces and win the ball back in advanced positions, Havertz can also play out wide or in a central striking position. He has been dubbed an ‘Alleskonner’ in his homeland – meaning a player who can do everything.
<br><br>
He has certainly shown he is a player for the big occasions at Chelsea – having scored the winning goal in the 2021 Champions League final and the FIFA Club World Cup final that followed.</p>

<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>The young German faced plenty of difficulties early in his first year in England, adapting to life in a new country during a pandemic, while suffering from injury and illness, but came through it all to finish the season with the greatest moment of his career so far.
<br><br><img src="media file/player/Havertz-goal-cl-final-2.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
  <br><br>
Once those initial fitness concerns were behind him, in addition to his combined 20 goals and assists, Havertz’s attacking versatility became crucial to our tactical flexibility.
<br><br>
That was especially so under Thomas Tuchel in the latter stages of 2020/21, at the business end of our triumphant Champions League campaign against Real Madrid and Manchester City.
<br><br>
Despite only joining Chelsea 10 days before the first game of our season, leaving him with very little in the way of a pre-season, Havertz went straight into Frank Lampard’s line-up to face Brighton on the opening day.
<br><br>
He started nine of our first 10 games in all competitions in a hugely promising start to his Blues career. That included a starring role in our Champions League win at Krasnodar and the first hat-trick of his career in only his third match for Chelsea, inspiring us to a 6-0 victory over Barnsley in the Carabao Cup.
<br><br>
However, having been a near ever-present early in his Chelsea career, Havertz was forced to step away from the action after contracting Covid-19 and taking longer than many to restore full fitness.
<br><br>
There were signs he was approaching his previous form with a goal and two assists in our first two games of 2021 and it appeared he benefitted from the move to a more central position under Tuchel. He put in several eye-catching performances as a number 10 or false-nine, getting better and better as the season approached a dramatic climax.
<br><br>
Our Premier League opponents were given fair warning in late April by his brilliant performance with a goal and an assist against Crystal Palace, shortly before netting twice in a 2-0 win over Fulham, but his two best games of the season came on the biggest stage.
<br><br>
The then 22-year-old was hugely influential in so much of what we did well in the final third of the pitch during the decisive second leg of our Champions League semi-final victory over Real Madrid, and even more was still to come in the final itself. In a show of brilliant composure, it was Havertz who rounded the goalkeeper and slotted in the goal that made Chelsea European champions once again in Porto. Not a bad way to end your first season with a new club!

</p>
	  </div>
		<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>During his second year at Chelsea, Havertz impressively built on his debut season as he continued to be a key player for Thomas Tuchel’s Blues.
<br><br>
In another season of notable goals, Kai netted the 2000th goal of the Roman Abramovich era in the last season of that ownership when he headed in Reece James’s cross in a 1-1 draw against Burnley at Stamford Bridge.
<br><br>
The German did have a quiet spell throughout the winter months, scoring twice between the months of November and January. However his next goal for the Blues was a trophy-lifting one.
<br><br>
With his cool penalty right at the end of the FIFA Club World Cup final in Abu Dhabi, Havertz became the first player to score the match-winning goal in the both the UEFA Champions League final and the subsequent FIFA Club World Cup final since Lionel Messi did so for Barcelona in 2011.
<br><br>
In mid-March 2022, Havertz also hit a late winner against Newcastle at the Bridge, a strike which ensured he had scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career, while in all competitions he had a hand in six goals in five games (five goals, one assist).
<br><br>
Kai also scored the 100th Premier League goal in the Thomas Tuchel era, against Watford on the final day of the season. He had upped his goal tally from nine in 2020/21 to a double-figure tally of 14 in his second season. His 20 goal involvements across the season were only bettered for Chelsea by Mason Mount.</p>
	  </div>
	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Havertz was an important part of both Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter's Chelsea sides during the first part of the 2022/23 season, featuring in all but one of our fixtures in all competitions up to the World Cup break in November and December.
<br><br>
He was in the starting line-up for six of Tuchel’s seven matches in the dugout, the one exception being the German coach’s last Premier League game, when Havertz came off the bench to slot in the winning goal against West Ham United at Stamford Bridge with two minutes left.
<br><br>
The forward’s role remained largely unchanged following the arrival of Potter, alternating between supporting the attack from wide and leading the line as a central striker, the latter being the case when he scored the goal which sealed our progress to the Champions League knock-out stages with a game to spare, netting a brilliantly curled winner at Red Bull Salzburg.
<br><br>
Further strikes against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League meant only Raheem Sterling had scored more for Chelsea before Christmas.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Having received his early education at local lower-league clubs Alemannia Mariadorf and Alemannia Aachen, the former run by his grandfather, Havertz joined Bayer Leverkusen at the age of 11 in 2010 and made a name for himself in their youth set-up, receiving the Silver Fritz Walter Medal in 2016, given to the best Under-17 players in Germany.
<br><br>
He made his senior debut that same year, becoming the club’s youngest Bundesliga debutant, and continued to grow in stature over the course of the 2016/17 season. He made his first Champions League start in that season’s last 16, although he missed the second leg of their defeat to Atletico Madrid because it clashed with his school exams. Before the end of the campaign he had his first goal, in a 3-3 draw with Wolfsburg, making him Leverkusen’s youngest Bundesliga scorer.
<br><br>
By the 2017/18 season, Havertz was a regular in the team at the BayArena and becoming increasingly influential to the side, helping them return to European competition with a fifth-place finish. After the arrival of Peter Bosz as manager, he was installed as the side’s key attacking outlet, playing behind the main striker, with his eye for goal on full display as he hit the back of the net 20 times in the Bundesliga and Europa League.
<br><br>
He was initially given more of a free role in 2019/20, able to roam on and off the ball, looking to win back possession high up the pitch and craft chances for his team-mates, creating 58 opportunities resulting in a shot on goal in the Bundesliga – more than any other Leverkusen player.
<br><br>
With centre-forward Kevin Volland ruled out for the second half of the season, Havertz often played as the focal point up front and proved himself more than capable, registering an impressive nine goals and six assists in 10 games in that role.
<br><br>
His form in Leverkusen resulted in Havertz breaking into international football.
</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Having captained Germany’s Under-19s, Havertz made his senior debut as a late substitute for Werner in a friendly against Peru in September 2018 and scored his first goal in a 2-2 draw with Argentina almost exactly a year later.
<br><br>
He was named in Germany's Euro 2020 squad and netted twice, against Portugal and Hungary, in the group stages. They exited to England at Wembley in the round of 16 but not before Havertz displayed his class once more.
<br><br>
He continued to be a regular choice as starter under new Germany boss Hansi Flick and scored goals in the 2022 World Cup qualification campaign.
<br><br>
Leading the attack for Germany, he hit a brace against England at Wembley in their last competitive fixture before the 2022 World Cup, and was named in the starting line-up for the opening game of the tournament.
<br><br>
He also came off the bench in their final group match to change the game, finding the back of the net twice as they came from behind to beat Costa Rica 4-2, although it wasn't enough to progress to the knock-out rounds.</p>
