<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">Quick and agile, Kepa possesses fantastic reflexes and developed his all-round game since establishing himself as Athletic Bilbao’s first-choice keeper. A great shot-stopper, he is confident with the ball at his feet and capable of playing out from the back.</p>
<button class="team-menu"> 2018/2019 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>The Spanish international goalkeeper signed a seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge and ended his first season with silverware as we beat Arsenal in the Europa League final. He played 54 games in all competitions, including 36 in the Premier League. In total he kept an impressive 23 clean sheets as he quickly adapted to the rigours of English football.
<br><br>
Kepa made his debut for the Blues just a few days after signing in our opening-day win at Huddersfield in August. The keeper looked assured when called into action and kept a clean sheet in a 3-0 victory.
	<br><br>	  
		  
		 <img src="media file/player/kepa_europa_league_trophy.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
	He was an ever-present in the Premier League during the first half of the 2018/19 season and kept nine clean sheets. After Christmas we reached the Carabao Cup final with Kepa starring in the penalty shoot-out success over Tottenham in the semis, a feat he would repeat at the same stage of the Europa League against Eintracht Frankfurt when he decisively kept out two penalties to send us to Baku.
<br><br>
Kepa's impressive form towards the finale of our domestic campaign played an important role in securing a third-placed Premier League finish.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2019/2020 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>The arrival of Frank Lampard in the summer of 2019 did nothing to diminish Kepa's standing as our number one and he started the first 24 Premier League games under the new boss. However, the number of goals conceded by the team throughout the season drew scrutiny and, in the spring, the Spaniard sat out five consecutive matches as Willy Caballero's form earned him a run between the posts.
<br><br>
Yet Kepa was at his best in our FA Cup victory over Liverpool in early March, our penultimate game before the unprecedented football pause, producing one remarkable triple save to keep the Reds at bay in a 2-0 victory at the Bridge. He kept another clean sheet five days later in a home league win over Everton and retained his starting spot when the season restarted in June but missed the final three games of the campaign, including the FA Cup final.

</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Following the arrival of Edouard Mendy, our Spanish keeper played every minute in the FA Cup, from the third round all the way through to the final, although it was disappointment for the Blues at Wembley against Leicester. Up to that point, Arrizabalaga had conceded just once in five matches in that competition, making an important reaction save to keep us ahead against Luton in the fourth round and a point-blank stop in the following match with the score locked at 0-0 against Barnsley.
<br><br>
The 26-year-old’s performance at Oakwell meant he kept his place four days later in the Premier League against Newcastle, where his best save of the campaign had Joe Willock’s downward header expertly tipped round the post. He started back-to-back games again in April and May, with Tuchel emphasising the importance of regular game time.
<br><br>
His 100th Chelsea appearance had come at the start of our FA Cup run as he kept a clean sheet in the third round against Morecambe.</p>
	  </div>
		<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Kepa remained behind Mendy in the pecking order at the start of the 2021/22 campaign, but still managed to play his part, as well as underlining his penalty prowess.
<br><br>
Kepa came off the bench for the shoot-out in the UEFA Super Cup against Villarreal, saving two penalties including denying Raul Albiol's decisive kick to secure the trophy for Chelsea. In addition to keeping a clean sheet in a 3-0 win at Tottenham, when Mendy was absent due to injury, the Spaniard made further shoot-out saves in Carabao Cup victories over Aston Villa and Southampton.
<br><br>
Those penalty heroics contributed to Kepa setting several new club records, as he surpassed Petr Cech's overall tally for shoot-out saves, as well as helping the Blues win three consecutive shoot-outs and three in the same season, neither of which had been achieved before in Chelsea history.
	<br><br>
	The Spaniard returned to help us record further Carabao Cup victories over Brentford and Tottenham, the latter over two legs, without conceding a goal to reach the final at Wembley.
<br><br>
After the second of those semi-final matches, Kepa was a regular in Tuchel's side throughout January, while Mendy was competing at the Africa Cup of Nations, starting all three Premier League fixtures that month, including another win and clean sheet against Spurs, before producing more penalty heroics, this time in the FA Cup, when his save two minutes from the end of extra time allowed us to hold on to our 2-1 lead over Plymouth Argyle in the fourth round.
<br><br>
He then travelled with the squad to the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, where with Mendy still absent, Kepa retained his place for the semi-final, making two vital saves in the 1-0 victory over Al Hilal en route to lifting the trophy for the first time. Mendy returned in time for the final.
	<br><br>
	After inspiring us to shoot-out victories over Villarreal, Aston Villa and Southampton earlier in the term, there was Wembley heartache and drama for Kepa in the Carabao Cup final.
<br><br>
Our well-honed plan of drawing on his expertise from 12 yards was followed once more against Liverpool but a mammoth run of 22 penalty kicks finally ended with the Spaniard blazing an effort of his own over the crossbar and into the Reds supporters.
<br><br>
Kepa’s final involvement of the campaign came a few days later in a win away at Luton Town in the FA Cup.</p>
	  </div>
	  <button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Kepa started the season as number two to Mendy but an injury to the Senegalese stopper at the start of September handed the Spaniard a chance. It was one he took, keeping Mendy out of the team when he returned to full fitness.
<br><br>
A couple of good saves at Crystal Palace at the start of October preceded a run of five consecutive clean sheets, Kepa's net finally breached in the fourth minute of stoppage time as we were cruelly denied a late win over Manchester United at the Bridge.
<br><br>
He had done more than anyone to preserve the clean sheets at Aston Villa and Brentford, especially in the first of those games when he made five first-half saves alone, the joint-most of his Chelsea league career. One, to tip Jacob Ramsey's shot onto the post, was chosen as the Premier League Save of the Month; in truth, a couple of other stops would have been in with a chance of winning that prize. He was also nominated for Player of the Month.
	<br><br>
	Unfortunately Kepa's impressive form was brought to a halt by a foot injury sustained at Brighton at the end of October, ruling him out until after the World Cup.</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born in Ondarroa, a Basque seaside town, Kepa joined the Athletic academy at the age of nine and after gaining experience at their fourth-tier feeder club Basconia, he appeared regularly for Bilbao’s B-team, earning international recognition at youth level due to the quality of his displays.
	<br><br>
Kepa was loaned to SD Ponferradina, a Spanish second division side, in January 2015 and having made his debut against Racing Santander, he started on a regular basis, keeping seven clean sheets in the process as the team missed out on the play-offs by just one point. He established himself in another second-tier loan move with Real Valladolid the next season, before returning to Bilbao for the 2016/17 campaign.
	<br><br>
Although not initially viewed as number one, he made his first appearance in an away game at Deportivo La Coruna, keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win. He went on to make over 20 appearances throughout a season which ended with him representing Spain at the European Under-21 Championship.
	<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/GettyImages-919920748.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
<br><br>
In the season prior to his switch to London, Kepa’s consistently impressive displays earned him regular plaudits inside and outside the club. He saved two of the three penalties he faced, as well as making the third-highest number of saves in the Spanish top flight and successfully executing more long-range passes – 368 – than any other goalkeeper in La Liga.		  
</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Kepa's impressive form at club level for Athletic Bilbao led to a debut for the senior Spain side, which came in a 5-0 win over Costa Rica in November 2017. He was duly named in the 23-man squad for the World Cup in Russia, and by 2019 was a regular between the posts for his country.
<br><br>
After keeping a clean sheet in his maiden European Championship qualifying appearance in March 2019 in a 2-0 win over Malta, Kepa featured in both June internationals that summer and shared glove duties with David De Gea until the end of 2020.</p>
