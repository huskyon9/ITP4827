<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: left;">His ability to suppress opposition wingers immediately impressed, along with his dependability in possession and increasing willingness to join the team’s attacks.
<br><br>
A strong beginning to life at Stamford Bridge earned Azpilicueta a first call-up to the full Spanish national team in early 2013, and he ended his first campaign in Chelsea blue with 48 appearances.
<br><br>
He has since proven capable of playing left-back and as one of a back-three defence, and ended his second season at the club by winning the Chelsea Players' Player of the Year award. He won his first Premier League title in 2015.
<br><br>
Azpilicueta was named club captain following the departure of Gary Cahill in 2019, having previously been vice-captain and worn the armband for that year’s Europa League final victory. He skippered the Blues to Champions League and Club World Cup finals in 2021 and 2022 respectively and lifted the trophy on both occasions.</p>
<button class="team-menu"> 2012/2013 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta made his debut for the club in a 6-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanders at Stamford Bridge in the Capital One Cup, playing the full 90 minutes. His first Premier League appearance came shortly after when he replaced Branislav Ivanovic midway through the second half of a 4-1 win against Norwich City, while his first league start came in the 1-1 draw with Swansea at the Liberty Stadium.
<br><br>
As the season progressed, the young defender went from strength to strength and established himself as a regular in the side at right-back, with Ivanovic playing more often than not in the centre of defence. Such was Azpilicueta's influence that, as the games piled up, and Benitez continued to rotate the side, he was one of the few players seldom rested.
<br><br>
He played an integral role as the Blues secured a third-place Premier League finish and completed the full 90 minutes in the Europa League final win over Benfica in Amsterdam, bringing his first season at the club to a triumphant finish.
<br><br>
The Spaniard then scored his first Chelsea goal from the penalty spot in a 4-3 post-season friendly defeat to Manchester City in the US.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2013/2014 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>With new manager Jose Mourinho preferring Ivanovic at right-back, Azpilicueta was limited to substitute cameos early in the campaign, though on his second start, against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup, he notched his first competitive goal for the Blues in a 2-0 win at the Emirates.
<br><br>
		  <img src="media file/player/PA-18050780_azpilicueta.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
With Ashley Cole injured the opportunity arose for Azpilicueta to start in the unfamiliar position of left-back in an away win at Schalke in late October. A fine performance in Germany heralded a run in the team for the Spaniard on the left side of the defence; even when Cole was deemed fit to play again.
<br><br>
That run at left-back continued until the end of a wonderful season for the Spaniard. When he was required to revert to right-back, for matches against Atletico Madrid and Liverpool, he made the transition seamlessly. He had formed a key part of the meanest defence in the country, which conceded just 27 league goals in 38 games, in turn making him close to indispensable in Jose Mourinho’s improving side.
<br><br>
Azpilicueta was rewarded for his performances when he won the Chelsea Players’ Player of the Year award, and he was also placed in the final four nominees for the Chelsea Player of the Year award. Team-mates and fans alike had taken note of the likeable defender’s outstanding on-field ability.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2014/2015 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta continued where he left off the previous campaign with a string of fine performances at left-back. Despite the arrival of Filipe Luis he maintained his position in the side and showed his tenacity to its full to set up Diego Costa’s winner in a satisfying away success at Liverpool in the November.
<br><br>
The Spaniard helped keep a clean sheet as the Blues vanquished Spurs in the Capital One Cup final and by the end of the Premier League-winning campaign he had made 29 appearances in that competition. It was his first league title.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2015/2016 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta scored his first league goal for Chelsea and his second overall with the winner away at West Brom in August 2015. That was the team's first win of the season and he continued to be Jose Mourinho's primary choice at left-back for the rest of the manager's time in charge, with the odd game at right-back when new signing Baba Rahman was given chances on the left.
<br><br>
He found the net again against West Brom in January although this time the team were denied all the points by a late equaliser. There then followed a significant spell back in his traditional position on the right flank when Branislav Ivanovic was asked to play centre-back in the absence of others, and by the end of the campaign Azpilicueta had played more minutes than anyone in the squad.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2016/2017 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta scored an absolute stunner as the Blues came back from 2-0 down to win a League Cup tie at Leicester but it was the return to his defensive best, as the right-sided member of the back-three selected by Antonio Conte at the start of October, that was the highlight of his early months with the new boss. An impressive run of clean sheets and club-record breaking sequence of wins were recorded. In one of those games, at Sunderland in December 2016, he made his 200th Chelsea appearance and that month he also signed a new contract committing himself to the club until June 2020.
<br><br>
  <img src="media file/player/azpilicueta-watford-2017-002.jpg" width="75%" height="75%" alt=""/>
		  <br><br>
By the end of his outstanding 2016/17 campaign, Azpilicueta had played every minute of every league game, only the fourth outfield player do so for a Premier League winning team. It was from his ball across goal that Michy Batshuayi scored at West Brom to seal the title. The following game, at home to Watford, he netted his one league goal of the season.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2017/2018 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta made 52 appearances throughout the 2017/18 season, the highest number of any player, and captained the side on 21 occasions, displaying fantastic leadership qualities when wearing the armband.
<br><br>
Once again, he played on the right-hand side of a three-man defensive unit, and while Azpilicueta remained as consistent and reliable as ever from a defensive perspective, at the other end of the pitch the Spaniard enjoyed his most fruitful campaign for the club, scoring three goals.
<br><br>
He enjoyed a fantastic on-pitch relationship with compatriot Alvaro Morata, with the striker profiting from Azpilicueta's crosses from deep on a number of occasions, most memorably to head home the winner in a home game against Manchester United.
<br><br>
He ended the season by helping the team keep a clean sheet as we overcame the Red Devils at Wembley to win the FA Cup.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2018/2019 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta skippered the side regularly over the course of the campaign, but the arrival of Maurizio Sarri led to a change in system, with the defender reverting to a right-back role in a 4-3-3 formation.
<br><br>
Azpi made a Chelsea-high 57 appearances across five different competitions, the last of which saw him skipper the Blues to victory in the Europa League with an emphatic win over Arsenal. His solitary goal was a late equaliser in a game at Cardiff we went on to win in March 2019, in what proved to be a crucial victory in the race for a top-four spot we eventually secured with a game to spare.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> 2019/2020 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Named permanent captain by Lampard following Cahill's departure, Azpilicueta remained a mainstay in the team. His usual versatility was on display too, as the Spaniard featured in four different positions across the season. He started the campaign at right-back and shifted to wing-back on occasion early in the season, as Lampard adjusted our formation, notably in the emphatic win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Following the emergence of Reece James, Azpilicueta also often featured at left-back and on the right of a three-man defence, a position he knew well from our title-winning 2016/17 campaign.
<br><br>
He displayed a happy knack in front of goal, scoring in Champions League home games against Ajax and Lille, and domestic draws with Brighton and Arsenal. His total of four at the end of the season made it the most productive in front of goal of his career so far and he could have had two more - VAR denied him an equaliser against Liverpool early on and a memorable winner in that Ajax epic.
<br><br>
As has often been the case during his Chelsea career, Azpi was a near ever-present throughout the season, missing just two Premier League games and playing more minutes than any other Blues player in that competition. He proved himself indispensable following the pause in the season caused by the coronavirus pandemic, being involved in every minute in the league following the restart. The loss of his presence when an injury forced him off with the scores tied at 1-1 in our eventual FA Cup final defeat further demonstrated the importance of his influence and experience in a young team
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2020/2021 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>The continued emergence of Reece James meant Azpilicueta was sharing right-back duties with his younger team-mate during the early stages of the season. The Spaniard started his fair share of matches and even when he didn't, provided an important option from the bench to help us hold a lead. His influence was most obvious when introduced at half-time against West Bromwich Albion, with the Blues 3-0 down. He showed all his experience and leadership qualities in our vastly improved second-half performance, as well as providing the assist for Mason Mount’s goal which sparked our comeback to salvage a 3-3 draw.
<br><br>
By the end of October, James had established himself in the right-back spot, limiting Azpilicueta’s playing time, particularly in the Premier League. There was no questioning his dedication, though, with manager and team-mates alike repeatedly highlighting his continued selfless influence in the squad, especially when helping James and the other younger members.
<br><br>
With the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as head coach in January, and his initial preference for experience while getting to know his new players, Azpilicueta was back in the starting line-up and showed how important he would be at both ends of the pitch in our new 3-4-3 system, when he charged forward from centre-back to score the first goal of the German’s reign, netting the opener in the 2-0 win over Burnley at the end of January.
<br><br>
His ability to slot seamlessly into the side in the back three or as a wing-back proved invaluable to Tuchel, who moved Azpilicueta, James and Callum Hudson-Odoi between roles depending on the opponents and specific demands of the match. Regardless of the position he occupied, our skipper was a near ever-present for Tuchel, missing just three games in all competitions after the manager’s arrival.
<br><br>
The fitness levels required for that consistency made a mockery of the suggestion footballers start to decline once they reach their 30s. In fact, some of Azpilicueta’s performances in the crucial matches at the end of 2020/21 were arguably his best yet in a Chelsea shirt, leading by example with dominant Champions League displays in the semi-final against Real Madrid and final victory over Manchester City, further underlining his credentials as a player who shines in the big games.
<br><br>
His impressive impact was recognised with a place on the 30-player shortlist for the 2021 Ballon d'Or, alongside four of his Chelsea team-mates.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2021/2022 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Azpilicueta underlined his status as one of the most successful players in Chelsea's history during the 2021/22 season, as he captained us to two more trophies before the end of February, meaning he had lifted every major piece of silverware during his time with the Blues.
<br><br>
The first was the UEFA Super Cup as he led the team out in Belfast for the 1-1 draw with Villarreal, which we won on penalties, erasing some painful memories for the defender who had twice previously been on the losing side with Chelsea in that competition.
<br><br>
Another of the few regrets of Azpilicueta's Chelsea career was rectified in February, when we travelled to Abu Dhabi for the FIFA Club World Cup, with our skipper the only remaining member of the squad who had also featured in our final loss to Corinthians on our solitary previous appearance at the tournament in 2012, the Spaniard's first season with the club.
<br><br>
On this occasion it was a happy ending, though, as he played every minute and showed some clever captaincy to take the pressure off Kai Havertz for the extra-time penalty which settled the final, before becoming the first Chelsea captain to lift the Club World Cup trophy.
<br><br>
Between those two triumphs, Azpi also scored his first-ever goal in the FA Cup, and first in any competition for over a year, with a clever back-heel flick in the 2-1 win over Plymouth Argyle at the Bridge in the fourth round.
<br><br>
Although we fell agonisingly short of claiming the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in the 2021/22 season – both times edged out by Liverpool on penalties at Wembley – it was another season of silverware for Azpilicueta and Chelsea.
	</p>
	  </div>

<button class="team-menu"> 2022/2023 ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Cesar Azpilicueta extended his Chelsea contract by two years at the start of August, and later that month he marked a decade of service to the Blues, making his 450th start in the defeat at Southampton.
<br><br>
Another milestone was reached in October as Azpi moved clear of Petr Cech (333 games) in our all-time Premier League appearance list, behind only John Terry (492) and Frank Lampard (429) now.
<br><br>
Although not a guaranteed starter, Azpilicueta was still involved in almost every game before the World Cup break, a regular choice off the bench if not selected. He was in the starting XI more frequently after an injury to Reece James in mid-October, earning him a berth in Spain's World Cup squad.
	</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> Before Chelsea ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>Born on 28 August 1989 in Pamplona, Navarre, Azpilicueta began his career at the academy of his hometown club, Osasuna. Having come through the ranks in Pamplona, Azpilicueta was handed his La Liga debut on 8 April 2007 against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.
<br><br>
The following season, with Osasuna depleted by injuries, the youngster featured regularly and cemented his place in the team at right-back with a string of impressive displays, while the 2008/09 campaign saw him miss only two games.
<br><br>
In June 2010, Azpilicueta made the switch from Spain to France, signing a four-year deal with Marseille. The youngster, however, endured a difficult opening to his career at the club suffering a knee injury which ruled him out for his first season.
<br><br>
Following the disappointment of the previous campaign, the 2011/12 season - with both the European Championships and Olympics on the horizon - was always going to be a big one for the young Spaniard. He flourished, performing consistently well and catching the eye as Marseille reached the Champions League quarter-finals, eventually eliminated by beaten finalists Bayern Munich.  
</p>
	  </div>
<button class="team-menu"> International career ↓ </button>
<div class="team-content">
      <p>At international level, he has represented Spain since earning a call-up to the Under-16s in 2005, and was part of the Under-19 side which won the European Championships back in 2007, as well as the Under-21s who tasted success in the same competition in 2011. After impressing during a sustained run in the side, Azpilicueta earned his first senior call-up for Spain for the friendly against Uruguay in February 2013, and played the full 90 minutes in a 3-1 win.
	<br><br>	  
He also featured for his national side at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, playing the full 90 minutes in an emphatic win against Tahiti and coming on at half-time in the final defeat to the host nation.
<br><br>
He was named alongside Chelsea team-mate Fernando Torres in Vicente Del Bosque’s World Cup squad for Brazil, where he started the opening two matches at right-back, and was again in the final selection for Euro 2016. At the tournament he made one appearance, coming on late in a group-stage win over Turkey. The defender was also selected for the 2018 World Cup squad although he was an unused sub throughout the campaign.
<br><br>
Despite not having appeared for his national team in nearly three years, Azpilicueta was named in the Spain squad for the delayed Euro 2020 tournament. After their disappointing start with two draws, the right-back was brought into the team for their third group game, helping them progress to the knockout stages with a 5-0 win over Slovakia. He kept his place in the line-up for the rest of the tournament as Spain reached the semi-finals before being eliminated by Italy in a penalty shoot-out, and scored his first international goal to give his country the lead in their dramatic 5-3 extra-time victory over Croatia in the last 16.
<br><br>
Three months later, he helped La Roja get some revenge on Italy with victory in the UEFA Nations League semi-final, but could not prevent the team falling to a 2-1 defeat to France in the final.
<br><br>
Azpilicueta was named in Spain's squad for the 2022 World Cup and featured throughout their emphatic start, when they opened their campaign with a 7-0 thrashing of Costa Rica. He also started their final group game and set up his former Chelsea team-mate Alvaro Morata to open the scoring against Japan, but was withdrawn at half-time with his side leading before a second-half collapse saw them defeated 2-1, and had to watch from the bench as Spain were eliminated in the last 16 by shock penalty shootout loss to Morocco.
